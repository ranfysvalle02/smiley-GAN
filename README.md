# Elevating GANs: Transitioning from Basic GANs to DCGANs

In our [previous post](https://github.com/ranfysvalle02/smiley-GAN/), we introduced the basics of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** by creating a simple model that generated basic smiley faces. This initial exploration provided a solid foundation, but to achieve more realistic and detailed images, we needed to enhance our approach. Enter the **Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)**â€”a more sophisticated architecture that leverages the power of convolutional neural networks to produce higher quality images.

## [Recap: The Basic GAN](https://github.com/ranfysvalle02/smiley-GAN/)

In our initial venture, we implemented a **Basic GAN** capable of generating simple smiley face images. This GAN comprised:

- **Generator**: A neural network using fully connected (linear) layers to transform a latent vector (random noise) into image data.
- **Discriminator**: A neural network also utilizing fully connected layers to differentiate between real and generated images.

While effective for generating rudimentary images, the Basic GAN had limitations in capturing intricate spatial features and producing high-fidelity outputs.

## Introducing DCGANs

**Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs)**, introduced by Radford, Metz, and Chintala in their [2015 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434), represent a significant advancement in GAN architectures. By integrating deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), DCGANs enhance the model's ability to generate detailed and realistic images.

**Key Features of DCGANs:**

1. **Convolutional Layers**: Replace fully connected layers with convolutional and transposed convolutional layers, improving spatial feature learning.
2. **Strided and Fractional-Strided Convolutions**: Utilize strides for downsampling and upsampling instead of pooling layers, maintaining spatial information.
3. **Batch Normalization**: Applied to stabilize training by normalizing layer inputs.
4. **Activation Functions**:
   - **Generator**: ReLU activations in hidden layers and Tanh in the output layer.
   - **Discriminator**: LeakyReLU activations to allow a small gradient when neurons are not active.
5. **No Pooling Layers**: Strided convolutions handle scaling, making pooling unnecessary.

By adopting these features, DCGANs achieve superior image quality and training stability compared to their basic counterparts.

            # Additional ConvTranspose2d layers...
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(feature_map_size, img_channels, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1, bias=False),
            nn.Tanh()
        )
    
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return self.net(x)

class Discriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, img_channels: int = 3, feature_map_size: int = 64):
        super(Discriminator, self).__init__()
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(img_channels, feature_map_size, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1, bias=False),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
            # Additional Conv2d layers...
            nn.Conv2d(feature_map_size * 8, 1, kernel_size=4, stride=1, padding=0, bias=False),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )
    
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return self.net(x).view(-1, 1).squeeze(1)
```
